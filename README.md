## Features

- Wildlife Calculator

## Foreword
Depending on when you read this, it might be safe to say this is a Work In Progress.
Some calculator existing do not work as intended or were not designed with this game in mind. Hence, for ease of doing the math, here's me getting the code out of the way.
I will update it whenever I'm free to do so, with more info and features. I plan to add more features soon.


## Roadmap
- [] Calculate based on Wildlife score
- [] Complete all chain items
- [] Add Wildlife chain items
- [] Add option for toggling merge 5s/ allowing extras.
- [] Feed for tips and tricks
- [] Event garden accessories
